Welcome to our project on combating deceptive imagery through deepfake and shallowfake detection. In this repository, we share our journey, strategies, and findings in two comprehensive notebooks.


1. Study Reproduction:

Explore the meticulous reproduction of a groundbreaking research study. Validate findings, analyze methods, and glean insights to establish a strong foundation for future exploration in deepfake detection.

2. Optimization:

  2.1-	Hyperparameter tuning: trying to best hypermeter values including the learning rate, the batch size, the number of epochs, using pytorch functionalities to try random values to find optimum ones for 
        hyperparameters.
 2.2-	Data augmentation: increasing the dataset size.

3.Our Vision and Continued Pursuit:

     At the heart of our project lies a vision for precise and effective deceptive image detection. While we've made significant strides, nearing results that showcase promise, our commitment to excellence doesn't 
    stop here. We're dedicated to pushing the boundaries of detection methodologies and advancing our research until we achieve the ultimate goal.
